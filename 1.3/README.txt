Project Name: Simulating Metamorphism in a Swarm Robotics System


This is the technical submission as partial fulfilment for my MMP.
The root directory contains Eclipse project files, a run.jar file, and a README.
The .jar file is a compiled technical submission.


/**** TO RUN ****/

The program has been compiled to a .jar application.

Double click on the 'run.jar' file, and the program should open.


/**** TROUBLESHOOTING ****/

Ensure the machine you are using has Java installed.

Ensure your machine associates .jar files with 'jarfile' by going to cmd and typing "assoc .jar".
This should respond with ".jar=jarfile".

Try running the .jar file through a terminal by using the "java -jar sim_1.3.jar‚Äù command.
